# storybook-manager

> 🚀 **Effortlessly generate and clean Storybook stories for all React components in your project.**
> Maintain consistent, up-to-date component documentation with zero manual work.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**storybook-manager** is a simple CLI tool that scans your `components/` directory and **automatically generates or removes Storybook stories** for every React component, including nested folders.

**Problem solved:**
Creating `.stories.tsx` files manually is time-consuming and error-prone. storybook-manager automates this process, making Storybook adoption effortless and your component library consistently documented.

**Target audience:**

- React developers building component libraries or design systems
- Frontend teams adopting Storybook
- Open-source projects maintaining reusable components

---

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Principles

- **Node.js CLI with TypeScript** for safety and maintainability.
- **fast-glob** for efficient recursive directory scanning.
- **ts-morph** for reliable analysis of TypeScript/JSX components.
- **Opinionated defaults:** assumes `./components/` as the root directory, no config needed.
- **Simplicity first:** only two clear commands: generate and clean.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Install globally

```bash
npm install -g storybook-manager
```

### 2️⃣ Or install locally as a dev dependency

```bash
npm install --save-dev storybook-manager
```

### 3️⃣ Add npm scripts to your project’s `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "story:generate": "storybook-manager generate",
  "story:clean": "storybook-manager clean"
}
```

### 4️⃣ Place your React components under a `components/` folder in your project root.

### 5️⃣ Import your global CSS in Storybook's `preview.ts`

Add the following line to your `.storybook/preview.ts` file to ensure your global styles are applied in Storybook:

```ts
import type { Preview } from "@storybook/nextjs-vite";
import "@/app/globals.css";
```

## 🚀 Usage

storybook-manager provides two intuitive commands:

### Generate stories

Scan `./components/` recursively and create `.stories.tsx` files next to each component.

```bash
npm run story:generate
```

### Clean stories

Recursively delete all `.stories.tsx` files under `./components`.

```bash
npm run story:clean
```
